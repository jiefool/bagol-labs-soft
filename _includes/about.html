              <h2>How we can help?</h2>
              <br/>
                <p>We are a group of technical people who happen to be awesome with computer programming and IoT devices. We are now living in a world where everything is affected with something digital, which is somehow we know how to manipulate. What we are trying to say really is we can build that piece of software or hardware that you think can help you. Of course in exchange for a fee. Letâ€™s say we give and take.</p>
